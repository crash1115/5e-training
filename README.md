## No Longer Being Maintained
Due to time constraints, I'm no longer able to keep updating this module with any amount of frequency. You're welcome to keep using it; there's a decent chance that it'll get updated from time to time because my group uses it, but I won't be keeping up with feature requests or non-critical bug reports at the level that'd be expected for something actively being maintained. Thanks for sticking with me on this wild ride, it's been a lot of fun!

If you're looking for an alternative to this module, p4535992 has taken up the mantle with [Downtime Dnd5e](https://github.com/p4535992/foundryvtt-downtime-dnd5e).

Does your group do a lot of downtime activities? Got a lot of factions? Need a simple quest log or timer? Do you have a hard time keeping track of... well... anything? Then this is the mod for you!

Tracking & Training is a module for the dnd5e system in Foundry VTT that adds a tab to all actor sheets (character and NPC) that lets you add and keep track of just about anything you can keep track of with a number and a progress bar. Finally working on that History proficiency? It's in here. Learning how to use thieves tools? In here. Need to keep track of how much of the town's water supply you've accidentally (I hope) poisoned? Quest progress! Countdown timers! Faction reputation! If you can measure it with a percentage, you can track it with this module.

## Got Questions? Find a Bug?
Create an issue right here on GitHub. If it's a critical/breaking bug, I'll try to fix it when I can. Feature requests likely won't be worked on unless I can find a use case for them with my groups that use this.
